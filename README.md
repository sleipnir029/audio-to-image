# audio-to-image

This is a script for visualizing audio files in a different way. It processes audio data and uses 'em as rgb values to create a picture.
So, now you can hear your favourite musics ðŸŽµ as well as see them as pictures ðŸ–¼. 

Audio files must be in `WAV` format. You can convert your audio files using [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), it's free and open-source.
